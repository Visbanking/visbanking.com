            p Visbanking was founded with one primary goal in mind: to provide banking industry information services that deliver real-time data and insights in an affordable, transparent, and integrated manner. Recognizing that other financial information services have traditionally been expensive, complex, and focused on do-it-yourself (DIY) reporting, we set out to create easy-to-use data visualization tools and innovative do-it-for-me (DIFM) customizable reports accessible via a license-based monthly subscription service.
            p Our software-as-a-service offerings include the vital multi-dimensional banking intelligence, valuations, pricing, data analysis, and visualization tools today's bank stakeholders, vendors, equity analysts, and distressed debt funds need to gather and analyze complex data, develop key strategies, and make informed decisions. 
            p In addition, we provide consulting services to select clients with bespoke needs for specialized data visualization, strategic planning, application development, and systems design and maintenance.

        aside
            p Like all good stories, Visbanking's history began with a challenge. Before launching the company, CEO Brian Pillmore was engaged in a consulting project for a regional bank that involved gathering vital banking information and delivering it in an accessible and understandable format. About a month into the project, the bank's leadership changed, and the project was ended as the new management decided to go in a different direction. The former leader's successor refused to pay for the work that had already been completed.
            p While that nonpayment was disappointing and challenging, Brian also recognized that the lemons he was being handed could be turned into lemonade. In his past role as President and Regional CEO of a bank, he had spent much of his time trying to win new business from his competitors. During that time, he had long recognized the need for accessible banking information about those rivals. Though his latest project was canceled without payment, Brian realized that the experience he gained could be leveraged to form the foundation for a service that could be provided to every bank.
            p From that point on, Brian and CTO Erdem Akka≈ü began working on what would soon become Visbanking, with the goal of creating a data-driven provider of banking information, visualizations, and insights focused on delivering the Do-It-For-Me documentation today's busy banking and finance industry professionals need.
